# Team Code of Conduct

## Our Culture & Pledge

As we build this startup, our goal is to create a high-performing, innovative, and inclusive environment. We pledge to make participation in our project and community a professional and harassment-free experience for everyone. We believe that diverse teams build better products and that a culture of respect is a competitive advantage.

## Collaborative Standards

To maintain a fast-paced but healthy startup culture, we encourage:

*   **Focus on the Mission:** Prioritize what is best for the product and the users.
*   **Radical Candor with Respect:** Give and accept constructive feedback. Critique code and ideas, not people.
*   **Assume Positive Intent:** When disagreements arise, assume your colleagues are trying to do the right thing.
*   **Professionalism:** Treat everyone with courtesy and dignity, regardless of their role or seniority.
*   **Bias for Action:** Move fast, but ensure your communication remains clear and respectful.

## Unacceptable Behavior

To protect our team morale and productivity, the following is unacceptable:

*   **Harassment:** Offensive comments, unwanted sexual attention, or intimidation of any kind.
*   **Personal Attacks:** Insults, derogatory nicknames, or belittling others' skills.
*   **Exclusion:** Deliberately excluding colleagues from vital conversations or decision-making.
*   **Trolling:** Disruptive behavior or stirring up unnecessary conflict.

## Enforcement responsibilities

The Founders and Engineering Leads are responsible for clarifying and enforcing these standards. They have the right to remove or edit contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to:
*   All project repositories and codebases.
*   Internal communication channels (Slack, Discord, Email).
*   Public representation of the startup (Social Media, Conferences).

## Reporting & Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior should be reported to the leadership team at me@rjtmahinay.com.

All complaints will be reviewed promptly and confidentially. Our priority is the safety and well-being of our team members.

### Consequences

Leadership generally follows this escalation path, though serious offenses may result in immediate termination or ban:

1.  **Correction:** A private conversation regarding the behavior.
2.  **Warning:** A formal written warning.
3.  **Removal:** Temporary or permanent removal from the organization or repository access for repeated or severe violations.
